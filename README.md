**AbyssVideoDownloader** is a command-line Kotlin application that allows users to download Abyss.to videos. It supports downloading videos in different resolutions.

## Prerequisites

Before using AbyssVideoDownloader, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK 21)**: [Download JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)

## Installation

You have two options for obtaining the `abyss-dl.jar` file:

1. **Download the Latest JAR File**:
   - You can download the latest `abyss-dl.jar` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/abdlhay/AbyssVideoDownloader/releases) section of this repository.

2. **Build the JAR File Manually**:
   - If you prefer to build the project yourself or want the latest updates, follow the instructions in the [**Building the Project**](https://github.com/abdlhay/AbyssVideoDownloader#building-the-project) section below.


## Usage

### Downloading a Video with AbyssVideoDownloader

To download a video, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Command**:
   Open your terminal and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar [-H <header>] [--header <header>] [-o <output_file_path>] [-c <number_of_connections>]
   ```

   - **Add HTTP Headers** (Optional):
      - Use `-H <header>` or `--header <header>` to include additional information with your request.
      - Example: `-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"`
      - You can add multiple headers by repeating the `-H` or `--header` option.

   - **Specify Output File** (Optional):
      - Use `-o <output_file_path>` to choose where to save the downloaded video.
      - Example: `-o /path/to/my_video.mp4`
      - If you donâ€™t specify a path, the video will be saved in the current directory with a default name.

   - **Set Number of Connections** (Optional):
      - Use `-c <number_of_connections>` or `--connections <number_of_connections>` to set how many connections to use for downloading. This can help speed up the download.
      - The number must be between 1 and 10 by default it is set to 6.
      - Example: `-c 7`

### Examples

1. **Download a video and save it with a specific name in a chosen folder**:
   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar -o /path/to/directory/my_video.mp4
   ```

2. **Download a video and save it with the default name in the current directory**:
   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar
   ```

3. **Download a video using custom headers**:
   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" --header "Referer: https://example.com" -o my_video.mp4
   ```

4. **Download a video with multiple connections**:
   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar -c 7 -o my_video.mp4
   ```

5. **Download a video using custom headers and multiple connections**:
   ```bash
   java -jar abyss-dl.jar -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" --header "Referer: https://example.com" -c 3 -o /path/to/my_video.mp4
   ```

6. After running the command, you will be prompted for the video URL:

## TODOs

Here are the planned tasks and features for future updates:

- [ ] Clean Code.
- [x] Add support for multiple parallel downloads.
- [ ] Integrate dependency injection maybe
- [ ] Improve error handling and provide more descriptive messages for common issues.
- [ ] Implement retry and resume logic for failed downloads.
- [ ] Enhance logging with different verbosity levels (e.g., debug, info, error).
- [ ] Add support for proxy configuration.
- [ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction or maybe an android app

Feel free to contribute by picking any task or suggesting new ones!
